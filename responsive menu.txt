This project is to show the use of responsive design with a navigation menu, a column section, and a footer section.  The technique used for this was using flex box, media queries and resizing of typographies to adjust to different sized device screens. The basic break points are geared towards a mobile phone type size, a tablet sized device, a laptop sized device, and then a larger screen typed device.
